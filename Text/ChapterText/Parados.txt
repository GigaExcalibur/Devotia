Parados: At the Root[X]

## ParadosGoalWindow
Eliminate Wister[X]

## ParadosStatusObjective
Cut off the rebellion[N]
by eliminating Wister.[X]

## ParadosOpeningCrawl1
I rise from the ashes scattered from[N]
Branches long lit ablaze due avarice,[AN]
The embers of ambition still caught[N]
In our breath: heaving, coughing,[AN]
Choking, suffocating, on the smoke.[AN]
But scarce time remains to take in[N]
The air and relish our victory,[A] for[N]
Just as she emerges victories from[N]
Her foe, do her knees buckle under.[AN]
I call out her name, and she turns to[N]
Me, eyes shadowed by the setting sun.[AN]
A crimson tear rolls down her cheek,[N]
And with a jolt of her lance, she[N]
Rips the gem from her foe's grasp.[AN]
It arcs in air, reaving light, until[N]
At last arriving within my grasp.[AN]
But feeling its weight in my hands,[N]
All the responsibility it commands,[AN]
Would I rather toss it to the sea[N]
So I could see all their faces again.[AN]
She shrinks from view, her form lost[N]
In the rolling fog, and the last I[N]
See of her is one more crimson tear.[A][X]

## ParadosOpeningCrawl2
[Red]
The blood pools at my feet, mixing[N]
With the fog and the infernal smoke.[AN]
All crumbles to dust around me, the[N]
Pillars and towers that have always[N]
Stood tall to signify Sarka's might.[AN]
I stand alone, unfailingly loyal, up[N]
Until the very end, as I always have.[AN]
I take no joy in my atrocities, the[N]
Crimes I have wrought for my cause,[AN]
For aught that's worth on the Eternal[N]
Scales. I will await my due judgement,[N]
Not shirk from just retribution.[AN]
My one regret is that I could not[N]
Walk with you in the garden of peace,[AN]
That for all my bluster and devotion,[N]
In the end blood was spilled for naught.[AN]
Should these words reach you, wherever[N]
You are, just know that above all else:[AN]
I loved you.[A][X]

[ML]As one, men! Break not your stride,[N]
Show them the strength of our hearts![AN]
//[R][LoadPeasant][FR][LoadPeasant]
[R]Hear, hear![AN]

[ML][LoadWister]
[ML]Push forward, men![.4] Show them no weakness,[N]
and grant them no quarter![AN]
Let the world know we'll be serfs no[N]
longer![.4] With me, my brothers![A][X]

[ML][LoadKlaudia]
[ML]Cur! Pay for disrupting[N]
House Sarka's order![A][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadWister]
[ML]I was about to say the[N]
same to you.[A][X]

[FL][LoadZero][L][LoadKlaudia][R][LoadJosephine][FR][LoadEmerson]
[L]Marze is only an hour's march away.[N]
Steel yourselves for the upcoming battle.[AN]
Our opponents may be mere villagers, but[N]
they're a threat to us all the same.[AN]
[R]And what are we here for?[AN]
If we're hunting down unarmed peasants,[N]
the least you could do is tell us why.[AN]
[FL][Beat]Chief Wister Difformi declared[N]
revolution against House Wolffia.[AN]
He cited an increase in taxes[Beat][AN]
[FR]Taxes?! Getting up in arms over such[N]
a miniscule issue[Beat] unforgivable.[AN]
[L]His cause is of no importance.[AN]
House Wolffia's knights were unable to[N]
suppress them, so it now falls to us.[AN]
Are you all prepared?[AN]
[FL][Beat]I promised your lord father[N]
I would protect you from harm.[AN]
My sword is yours, Klaudia[Beat][AN]
[R]I'll be frank. I don't support this.[AN]
But I'm in your service, and there's[N]
nothing I can do about that.[AN]
[FR]So long as I get more experience[N]
I'm with you all the way, milord.[AN]
[L]Excellent.[.4] For the honor of House Sarka![A][X]

## ParadosDevotiaWelcomeText
Ere we raise the curtain on Devotia,[N]
One matter remains yet unsettled.[AN]
Wouldst thou like to be shown[N]
Short tooltips on this hack's new[N]
Mechanics upon their introduction?[N]
[Yes][X]

## ParadosConfirmationText
Joyous day. Let us now herefore raise[N]
The Curtain on this glorious Show.[N]
Should thy player feel lost amidst[N]
The episodes, pray consult the [Red]Playbill[Red][N]
And open thy ears to the [Red]Chorus[Red].[AN]
I bid thou to sit, relax, and enjoy[N]
This showing of Devotia Exhibition![A][X]

## ParadosChorusText
I stand, one among few against legion,[N]
As the drums of war start their beat.[AN]
They are reckless, untrained, in thrall[N]
To the flames of their ideals, and all[N]
Too willing to throw themselves to it.[AN]
Their captain, too, his patience will[N]
Wear thin in time, ill content to sit[N]
And watch his revolution smother.[AN]
They come with chipped blades and dull[N]
Tools, stranger still some brandish[N]
Remedial written magical tomes.[AN]
But they know not the fine points of[N]
Weapon matchups, the burst of poise[N]
When fighting at advantaged type.[AN]
So long as I apply pike to dirk, and[N]
Natural to holy, our will is won.[A][X]

## ParadosTrapTutorialText
[Red]Purple tiles[Red] indicate positions of[N]
enemy reinforcements next turn.[AN]
These are NOT ambush spawns.[A][X]

## ParadosMultiItemText
Generic enemies in Devotia will[N]
almost never have multiple weapons.[AN]
If they do, they will always also[N]
possess an item that can be stolen.[AN]
An icon will show for these enemies[N]
on the map.[A] Check class descriptions[N]
to see who in Devotia can steal.[A][X]

## ParadosItemTypesText
Weapons in Devotia come in three main[N]
categories: [Red]normal[Red], [Red]jagged[Red], and [Red]heavy[Red].[N]
Be aware of them as you fight enemies.[AN]
Jagged weapons are identical to normal[N]
weapons, but they target the opposite[N]
defensive stat to their counterpart.[AN]
Heavy weapons are strong but locked[N]
to 1 range, cannot double, and the[N]
wielder always strikes last in combat.[AN]
This applies to every weapon type, so[A][X]

The vast majority of recruitment[N]
conditions are very straightforward.[A][X]
