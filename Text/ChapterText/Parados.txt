[ML]Push forward, men![.4] Show them no weakness,[N]
and grant them no quarter![AN]
Let the world know we'll be serfs no[N]
longer![.4] With me, my brothers![A][X]

[ML]Cur! Pay for disrupting[N]
House Sarka's order![A][ClearFace]

[FL][LoadZero][L][LoadKlaudia][R][LoadJosephine][FR][LoadEmerson]
[L]Marze is only an hour's march away.[N]
Steel yourselves for the upcoming battle.[AN]
Our opponents may be mere villagers, but[N]
they're a threat to us all the same.[AN]
[R]And what are we here for?[AN]
If we're hunting down unarmed peasants,[N]
the least you could do is tell us why.[AN]
[FL][Beat]Chief Wister Difformi declared[N]
revolution against House Wolffia.[AN]
He cited an increase in taxes[Beat][AN]
[FR]Taxes?! Getting up in arms over such[N]
a miniscule issue[Beat] unforgivable.[AN]
[L]His cause is of no importance.[AN]
House Wolffia's knights were unable to[N]
suppress them, so it now falls to us.[AN]
Are you all prepared?[AN]
[FL][Beat]I promised your lord father[N]
I would protect you from harm.[AN]
My sword is yours, Klaudia[Beat][AN]
[R]I'll be frank. I don't support this.[AN]
But I'm in your service, and there's[N]
nothing I can do about that.[AN]
[FR]So long as I get more experience[N]
I'm with you all the way, milord.[AN]
[L]Excellent.[.4] For the honor of House Sarka![A][X]

## ParadosDevotiaWelcomeText
Welcome to Devotia Exhibition! My name[N]
is Dragz, and I will be your humble[N]
stage manager for this production.[AN]
This demo currently features two[N]
gameplay chapters and one dialogue[N]
only stasimon (intermission).[AN]
Just one order of business before[N]
we can begin the show.[AN]
Would you like to view short[N]
tooltips about Devotia's unique[N]
mechanics on first introduction?[N]
[Yes][X]

## ParadosConfirmationText
Fantastic! If you're ever confused[N]
about anything in Devotia, you can[N]
check the [Red]Playbill[Red] and [Red]Backstage[Red].[AN]
The Playbill serves as a guide to[N]
characters, lore, and mechanics,[AN]
while Backstage is a per-chapter[N]
briefing on any notable aspects.[AN]
With all that said, please enjoy[N]
Devotia Exhibition![A][X]

## ParadosBackstageText
[ML][LoadStageManager]
[ML]Greetings, player, and welcome backstage.[AN]
I am here as your tour guide through[N]
Devotia's innermost workings.[AN]
Parados is comparatively simple,[N]
but watch Wister's movement.[AN]
Just as the pacing of a show cannot[N]
slow to a crawl,[A] so too cannot[N]
bosses stay sedentary eternally.[AN]
Furthermore, notice that Wister[N]
possesses a copper-filled pouch.[AN]
The prospective player could pinch[N]
that pouch with Zero's action,[AN]
should they have the firepower[N]
to dispatch him with the others.[AN]
This concludes today's tour backstage,[N]
I hope to see you again![A][X]

## ParadosTrapTutorialText
[Red]Purple tiles[Red] indicate positions of[N]
enemy reinforcements next turn.[AN]
These are NOT ambush spawns.[A][X]

## ParadosMultiItemText
Generic enemies in Devotia will[N]
almost never have multiple weapons.[AN]
If they do, they will always also[N]
possess an item that can be stolen.[AN]
An icon will show for these enemies[N]
on the map.[A] Check class descriptions[N]
to see who in Devotia can steal.[A][X]

## ParadosItemTypesText
Weapons in Devotia come in three main[N]
categories: [Red]normal[Red], [Red]jagged[Red], and [Red]heavy[Red].[N]
Be aware of them as you fight enemies.[AN]
Jagged weapons are identical to normal[N]
weapons, but they target the opposite[N]
defensive stat to their counterpart.[AN]
Heavy weapons are strong but locked[N]
to 1 range, cannot double, and the[N]
wielder always strikes last in combat.[AN]
This applies to every weapon type, so[A][X]
