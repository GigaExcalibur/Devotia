## WeaponTriangleEntry
Weapon Triangle[X]

## WeaponTriangleContent
The weapon triangle in Devotia[N]
is +/- 25 Hit and 5 Mt.[N]
Reavers reverse the triangle,[N]
but do not double it.[X]

## DoublingThresholdEntry
Doubling Threshold[X]

## DoublingThresholdContent
The doubling threshold in[N]
Devotia is 3 Attack Speed.[X]

## WeaponCategoriesEntry
Weapon Categories[X]

## WeaponCategoriesContent
Weapons in Devotia come in 3[N]
categories: normal, jagged,[N]
and heavy.[N]
[N]
Jagged weapons are identical[N]
to normal weapons, but target[N]
the opposite defensive stat.[N]
[N]
Heavy weapons are powerful,[N]
but cannot double and the[N]
wielder always strikes last.[N]
[N]
These three categories apply[N]
to every weapon type, so be[N]
on the lookout for them![X]

## StavesConsumableItemsEntry
Staves / Consumable Items[X]

## StavesConsumableItemsContent
Devotia features many staves[N]
and consumable items usable[N]
on ally and enemy alike, from[N]
staves that boost stats to[N]
items that make enemies take[N]
effective damage from various[N]
tomes.[N]
[N]
Some notes on them:[N]
- Item effects can only apply[N]
to a unit once, so don't use[N]
the same items on a unit[N]
multiple times in 1 turn.[N]
- Effective damage multipliers[N]
for tomes are all 2x, except[N]
for bows on levitating foes.[N]
- Bows and effective anima[N]
tomes are the only sources of[N]
effective damage in Devotia.[X]

## SkillsEntry
Skills[X]

## SkillsContent
All playable units in Devotia[N]
possess one medium-to-high[N]
impact personal skill and[N]
one PRF weapon/item.[N]
[N]
All infantry get Shove and all[N]
cavalry get Canto, but I don't[N]
really consider them "skills".[N]
They're just game mechanics.[N]
[N]
Generic enemies will never[N]
have skills, and bosses will[N]
only have one skill that[N]
negates effective damage.[X]

another in his repertoire, and[N]

Ouahed's magic academy, but[N]
her parents pulled her out to[N]
become a knight when the money[N]
dried up. She's served the[N]
house for 7 years, but hopes[N]
to escape her duty and become[N]
a wandering trobairitz. She[N]
prays she makes it through[N]
this production of Devotia.[X]

## WesleyEmersonEntry

serve as a hedge knight in[N]
this production of Devotia.[N]
[N]

lineage of retainer knights,[N]
as a child born their parents[N]
were killed in an enemy ambush.[N]
Since then Emerson trained[N]
day and night to live up to[N]
their example, and they hope[N]
that's reflected in their[N]
performance in Devotia![X]

role ever, having previously[N]
lived as an ordinary grape[N]
farmer in a Wolffian village.[N]
But at such a young age she's[N]
got big ambitions, and she[N]
wants all of you there to see[N]
her reach them in Devotia![X]

at the bit to be a stevedore[N]
in Devotia Exhibition![N]
[N]
Her previous work consisted of[N]
raiding villages in Drek,[N]
pillaging from the weaker,[N]
and fleeing from the stronger.[N]

strong, she hopes you can see[N]

## OffTheStringEntry
Off the String[X]

## OffTheStringContent
Devotia started in a Discord[N]
server for my friend group[N]
called Off the String. I was[N]
gushing about how impressive[N]
the hacks shown off at FEE3[N]
2022 were, and one person[N]
offhandedly suggested that[N]
we create a server romhack.[N]
I jumped at the opportunity,[N]
having had the premise for[N]
Devotia's story swimming in[N]
my head for several months,[N]
and quickly immersed myself[N]
in making a hack.[N]
[N]
I'm so, so, deeply grateful[N]
for the members of Off the[N]
String. They supported me[N]
through thick and this for[N]
this project, even as I[N]
procrastinated by switching[N]
engines, entering a hacking[N]
contest, and contributing to[N]
a community project. They're[N]
the goddamn best people I know,[N]
and I want to make them proud[N]
with Devotia Exhibition.[X]

Drums of War (Parrhesia)[X]

## DrumsOfWarContent
A familiar sun set over foreign[N]
soil. The Aulestri pulled back,[N]
leaving swathes of their own[N]
behind, their fierce legions[N]
left broken against the[N]
rag-tag militias of the[N]
Federal Guard.[N]
[N]
It wasn't enough. It would[N]
never be enough. Tomorrow, the[N]
legions would resume the attack;[N]
rested, reinforced, against[N]
starving, demoralised and[N]
desperate conscripts.[N]
[N]
Tomorrow, the Guard[N]
would break...[X]

## ThreeLegaciesContent
The story begins in the unified[N]
nation of Fodlan, 20 years[N]
after a great war in which[N]
the Four Heroes - Edelgard,[N]
Dimitri, Claude, and Yuri -[N]
defeated the forces of the[N]
ancient underground civilization[N]
of Agartha and their villainous[N]
High Priest, Thales.[N]
[N]
Fodlan has been unified under[N]
Emperor Edelgard, and has[N]
since slowly rebuilt itself[N]
from the war's devastation[N]
while undergoing governmental[N]
reforms.[N]
[N]
A new generation of students[N]
comes to attend the Officers[N]
Academy, led by Elys Agastyn,[N]
Alexander Kleiman, and Ashley[N]
von Riegan. The future looks[N]
promising. But peace remains[N]
all too fragile...[X]

Two years ago, the King of[N]
Melerra was deposed by several[N]
powerful nobles backed by the[N]
Empire of Galt, and the[N]
Kingdom was ceded to the[N]
Empire as a vassal state.[N]
[N]
Prince Edgar, the sole survivor[N]

gathers allies in hopes of[N]
liberating his nation. His[N]
