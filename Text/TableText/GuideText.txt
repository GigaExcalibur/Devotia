## WeaponCategoriesEntry
Weapon Categories[X]

## WeaponCategoriesContent
Weapons in Devotia come in 3[N]
categories: normal, jagged,[N]
and heavy.[N]
[N]
Jagged weapons are identical[N]
to normal weapons, but target[N]
the opposite defensive stat.[N]
[N]
Heavy weapons are powerful,[N]
but cannot double and the[N]
wielder always strikes last.[N]
[N]
These three categories apply[N]
to every weapon type, so be[N]
on the lookout for them![X]

## StavesConsumableItemsEntry
Staves / Consumable Items[X]

## StavesConsumableItemsContent
Devotia features many staves[N]
and consumable items usable[N]
on ally and enemy alike, from[N]
staves that boost stats to[N]
items that make enemies take[N]
effective damage from various[N]
tomes.[N]
[N]
Some notes on them:[N]
- Item effects can only apply[N]
to a unit once, so don't use[N]
the same items on a unit[N]
multiple times in 1 turn.[N]
- Effective damage multipliers[N]
for tomes are all 2x, except[N]
for bows on levitating foes.[N]
- Bows and effective anima[N]
tomes are the only sources of[N]
effective damage in Devotia.[X]

## SkillsEntry
Skills[X]

## SkillsContent
All playable units in Devotia[N]
possess one medium-to-high[N]
impact personal skill and[N]
one PRF weapon/item.[N]
[N]
All infantry get Shove and all[N]
cavalry get Canto, but I don't[N]
really consider them "skills".[N]
They're just game mechanics.[N]
[N]
Generic enemies will never[N]
have skills, and bosses will[N]
only have one skill that[N]
negates effective damage.[X]

A familiar sun set over foreign[N]
soil. The Aulestri pulled back,[N]
leaving swathes of their own[N]
behind, their fierce legions[N]
left broken against the[N]
rag-tag militias of the[N]
Federal Guard.[N]
[N]
It wasn't enough. It would[N]
never be enough. Tomorrow, the[N]
legions would resume the attack;[N]
rested, reinforced, against[N]
starving, demoralised and[N]
desperate conscripts.[N]
[N]
Tomorrow, the Guard would break...[X]

The story begins in the unified[N]
nation of Fodlan, 20 years[N]
after a great war in which[N]
the Four Heroes - Edelgard,[N]
Dimitri, Claude, and Yuri -[N]
defeated the forces of the[N]
ancient underground civilization[N]
of Agartha and their villainous[N]
High Priest, Thales.[N]
[N]
Fodlan has been unified under[N]
Emperor Edelgard, and has[N]
since slowly rebuilt itself[N]
from the war's devastation[N]
while undergoing governmental[N]
reforms.[N]
[N]
A new generation of students[N]
comes to attend the Officers[N]
Academy, led by Elys Agastyn,[N]
Alexander Kleiman, and Ashley[N]
von Riegan. The future looks[N]
promising. But peace remains[N]
all too fragile.[X]
