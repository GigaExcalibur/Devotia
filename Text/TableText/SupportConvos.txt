[ML]Whoa. Hey there. If you're here, it[N]
means you're in the Support Room.[AN]
There's nothing to see in here, but[N]
thanks for checking it out anyway.[A][X]

[ML]Puny mortals[Beat] you think you can[N]
stand up to the force of my storm?![AN][CSS][CF]
[MR][LoadAstraea]
[MR]I don't think - I know so![A] For you see,[N]
we have the ultimate weapon! Take this![AN][CSS]
[MR][MoMR][CF]
[ML][LoadAstraea]
[ML]No[Beat] the Sacred Needle![N]
But how?![AN][CSS][CF]
[MR][LoadAstraea]
[MR]Take this![MoMR]And that![MoMR]
And some of- AH![AN]
Ow ow ow ow ow[Beat][AN]
[ML][LoadOrion]
[ML]What was that?! I heard a scream.[AN]
And[Beat] why is there tarp scattered[N]
all over the floor?[AN]
[MR]Ah, ah, sir! I-It's nothing.[AN]
It's just[Beat] been quite some time since[N]
Klaudia stopped to restock supplies.[AN]
Our tents are torn, and so I took[N]
it upon myself to fix them.[AN]
[ML]By yourself? This volume of canvas[N]
would take a man weeks to do alone.[AN]
If you'd like, I can-[AN]
[MR]N-no no, that won't be necessary,[N]
not at all![AN]
I'm a proper and capable lady, if I[N]
couldn't do this I couldn't do anything![AN]
So please, just leave me and hands be-[AN]
[ML]Wait, hold on, what's with your hands?[AN]
[MR]Eep![AN][CSS]
[MR][MoFR][ML][MoMR]
[FR]D-don't touch me! And there's nothing[N]
wrong with my hands, nothing at all![AN]
[ML]What the- your hands are bleeding![AN]
You must've fumbled your needle, we need[N]
a healer before the wound festers.[AN][CSS][MoML]
[FR][MoMR]
[MR]No no no, please, don't do it![AN]
I-If they knew I wasted precious bandages[N]
because I was distracted while working[Beat][AN]
Sir please, you can't![AN]
[ML][Beat]Very well. I won't let anyone know[N]
about your mistake: one two conditions.[AN]
First, you let me patch your wounds.[AN]
It wouldn't do for your hands to get[N]
infected from such a minor prick.[AN]
[MR][Beat]Mhm.[AN]
[ML]And second, whenever you decide to take[N]
on such a large task, you tell me first.[AN]
[MR]But[Beat] but why, sir?[AN]
[ML]Because it's either me or Lord Klaudia.[AN]
Well? Do you accept?[AN]
[MR][Beat]Very well. I accept.[A][X]

[ML][Beat]At last, a moment of calm.[AN]
Now then:[AN]
[dquote]It is duty - truly, duly, no[N]
hint of ambition - that compels me.[AN]
I, Princess Ethelrena of Aukema,[N]
can stand in the shadow no- AH![AN]
[MR][LoadOrion]
[MR]You've gone pale. Did I frighten you?[AN]
[ML]Y-yes, you did! What are you[N]
doing here, sir Orion?[AN]
[MR]Watching over you, as always.[AN]
Your hands, how are they?[AN]
[ML]Bandaged, although they itch.[AN]
[Beat]Sir Orion, do you not have anything[N]
better to do with your time?[AN]
I need no fretting over.[AN]
[MR]Better to fret than mourn.[AN]
That you're still alive now[Beat] well,[N]
forgive a man to say it's a miracle.[AN]
This war has taken far, far, far[N]
younger than you, Astraea.[AN]
I[Beat] I cannot lose more under my wing.[AN]
[ML]Then I beseech you, please leave me.[AN]
I-I am a proper lady of House Circe,[N]
almost of age, not to be minded so.[AN]
[MR]And leave you to slave over[N]
torn tents and ripped hands?[AN]
To be cleaved in half by a[N]
stray strike of an axe?[AN]
All I wish is for children to[N]
live past this war happily.[AN]
[ML]If that's truly what you wish,[N]
then please leave me alone![AN]
You've done nothing but hold me[N]
back, stop me from working.[AN]
If[Beat] if I need you to protect[N]
me, then I am a disgrace.[AN]
[MR][Beat]Is that truly how you feel?[AN]
I had only wished to help, but[N]
if you so insist[Beat][AN][CSS][CF]
[ML]Such sorrow, and yet[Beat] and yet[Beat][N]
I cannot let him see me like this.[AN]
I must[Beat] I must prove him wrong.[A][X]

[ML][LoadAstraea][MR][LoadOrion]
[ML]Orion. I[Beat][AN]
[MR]Astraea? Is something the matter?[AN]
[ML]Last we spoke, you caught me scrawling[N]
in this notebook. I want you to see it.[AN]
[MR]This is[Beat] prose. And quite dense, at that.[N]
When did you start writing this?[AN]
[ML]The idea came when I was six, locked in[N]
my quarters for failing a dance lesson.[AN]
In such fleeting moments when I finished[N]
my duties, I began to pen the story.[AN]
[MR]It must have taken a very long time.[AN]
[ML]Indeed. The story is still incomplete,[AN]
only going until after the princess[N]
finally reveals her true identity.[AN]
[MR][Beat]Why show me this?[AN]
[ML]I[Beat] I've decided what I want to do.[AN]
I want to survive this war and finish[N]
this novel, no matter what. And yet[Beat][AN]
[MR]That's a wonderful goal, Astraea.[AN]
[ML]What will you do after the war, Orion?[AN]
[MR]That's a question for the ages.[AN]
I[Beat] I confess I never gave much thought.[AN]
The things I've seen, the men that died[N]
under my watch[Beat] I have nothing left.[AN]
No house, no family to return to.[AN]
[ML]Then[Beat] would you like us to be a family?[AN]
[MR]Astraea? What are you suggesting?[AN]
[ML]You know as well as I that House[N]
Circe is gone. I am its last heir.[AN]
I no longer have any title to inherit,[N]
nor anyone to scorn me for failing it.[AN]
I[Beat] I want you to take me in[N]
as your own child.[AN]
[MR]Are[Beat] are you certain you want me[N]
for such a heavy responsibility?[AN]
[ML]I would not have it any other way.[AN]
You've looked out for me thus far,[N]
without you I wouldn't be here.[AN]
And I don't want to lose you.[AN]
[MR]I[Beat] I could not bear losing you either.[AN]
And if this is what you wish, then[N]
I will gladly accept.[AN]
And[Beat] it may sound silly, but[N]
may I confide in you my dream?[AN]
[ML]Of course.[AN]
[MR]I want to open a school.[AN]
I've fought so that children live to the[N]
end of the war, but it doesn't end there.[AN]
I want to make sure they live full,[N]
happy, carefree lives.[AN]
Astraea, would you like to be[N]
my first student?[AN]
[ML]I would love nothing more. Now, let's[N]
make our dreams a reality, father![A][X]
